# Sensor-Android
Sensor Lab4 <br>
Determine what sensors are available on your device  <br>
List them on your device. <br>
Code one of the sensors and output results, proving that you are tracking the sensor.  <br> 
If you are using an emulator, just switch it from portrait to landscape to get the coordinates to work. <br>
Hints: <br>
• Use getSensorList to get the available sensors. <br>
• Register and unregister your sensor in OnResume and OnPause <br>
• Override onSensorChanged and onAccuracyChanged. <br>
• Code onSensorChanged – that’s where the work is done <br>
